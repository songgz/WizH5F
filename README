== Welcome to Wizh5f

HTML5 has a built-in validation that doesn't require any JavaScript.
However, currently, it only works in Webkit browsers and can't be used in Firefox, Opera or IE.

Wizh5f is a mootools plugin that adds the lacking HTML5 form validation features to non-compatible browsers.

It doesn't require any custom functions or coding. Just create your form with the HTML5 syntax and it'll execute them automatically.
